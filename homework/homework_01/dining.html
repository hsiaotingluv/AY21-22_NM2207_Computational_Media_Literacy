      <p>Dining is an integral part of living in a CAPT. More often than not, spontaneous conversations along the corridor or over the dining table add to the warmth and vibrancy of college life. Mealtimes are also occasions to meet Fellows (and their families!) informally and chat about anything under the sun.</p>
      <p class="body">The dining hall at CAPT serves nutritious food from a range of cuisines, including <strong>Asian, Western, Malay (Halal), Indian (Halal) and Vegetarian.</strong> The meal plan includes <em>breakfasts on Mondays to Saturdays and dinners on Sundays to Fridays.</em></p>
